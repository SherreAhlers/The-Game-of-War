Pseudo code for the card game War
A deck of 32 cards is dealt between two players face down.

Both players turn a card over at the same time and place in middle of table side by side.
    -- Whomever's card is higher takes both cards and places at bottom of their deck.
If both players turn over a card with the same value it becomes war!

    -- While in War 
        Both players place 3 cards face down over original card played
        and place one card face up 
        -— Whichever player turns over the higher card wins all cards on table 
        —- If both players turn over card with same value, another war begins 
            and players will place 3 more cards face down on their pile and one card face up
            until there is a card higher than opponent.
First player to collect full deck of cards wins.
